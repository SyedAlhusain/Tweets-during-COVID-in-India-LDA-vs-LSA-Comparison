# Topic Modeling on Indian Tweets during COVID-19
## Achievements:

- Successfully implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for topic modeling on a dataset of Indian tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Processed and preprocessed the tweet data, handling NaN values, removing special characters and punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
- Tokenized words and created a bag of words representation of the corpus.
- Built and trained an LDA model to extract topics from the tweet corpus.
- Constructed an LSA model for comparative analysis with the LDA model.
- Visualized and presented the top words for each topic in both LDA and LSA models using bar charts.
- Demonstrated skills in working with natural language processing (NLP) libraries such as nltk and gensim.
- Utilized pandas for data manipulation and visualization libraries like matplotlib.

## Skills Demonstrated:

- Data Handling: Loaded tweet data from a CSV file using pandas, addressed missing values, and preprocessed text data for analysis.
- Text Processing: Cleaned and tokenized text, handled special characters and punctuation, and converted text to lowercase.
- Topic Modeling: Implemented LDA and LSA models for extracting topics from the tweet corpus.
- Visualization: Presented topic results through bar charts for both LDA and LSA models.
- Programming Languages: Proficient in Python and libraries such as pandas, nltk, gensim, and scikit-learn.
